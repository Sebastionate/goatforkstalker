ITEM.longdesc = "A chemical artifact composed of pressed and fossilized planet matter, animal debris, and soil. Curiously, tests applied to the Stone Blood to date the age of the fossils contained within show that the artifact is made of recent matter, including occasional discovery of fossils resembling human bones - implying the Stone Blood is formed via a mixture of chemical anomalies melting down matter and applying immense amounts of pressure. Whatever the case, the Stone Blood redirects deadly chemicals into itself, protecting the user."
