ITEM.longdesc = "A favorite among stalkers, the Fireball is an artifact formed in flame-based anomalies that dissipates heat via an equalization process unknown to science. Despite appearing as a crystalized orb of fire, the Fireball maintains a temperature of 75Â° Fahrenheit in a radius around itself, which stalkers can use to lessen the ambient heat around them. However, the Fireball emits radiation during the cooling process."
