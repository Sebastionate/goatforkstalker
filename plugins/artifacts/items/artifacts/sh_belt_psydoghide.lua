ITEM.longdesc = "Unlike its non-psionic cousin, psydog fur is actually quite soft to the touch and is seen as high-end Zone fashion, used to make clothing for the colder months or as blankets. For protection, its soft fur isn't quite as good at taking blows, but it tends to catch harmful chemical particles that would otherwise find its way to the user, and due to the creature's psionic nature also seems to help block psy rays. Just be sure to clean thoroughly to ensure those harmful particles don't build up."
