TRAIT.description = "You've probably seen combat, and you know the best way to keep your friends alive - by keeping the enemies down.\nDuring your turn when using a Heavy Weapon, you may take the Suppressive Fire action. Instead of attacking, you expend your shots without attacking a specific enemy, up to your RPM. For the next turn, the enemy's movement is halved and their DC to hit is increased by 1 per shot expended in the action."
