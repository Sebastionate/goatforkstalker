ITEM.longdesc = "A wonderful protective suit for the Zone, mostly appreciated because it combines excellent anomaly protection with more than adequate bullet-proofing qualities. Its design innovates off the PSZ-9d suit, integrating a closed cycle breathing system and an anomalous suppression device. While Duty doesn't tend to hunt for artifacts, these suits are favored by mutant-killing Hunter squads who often have to brave areas swamped with anomalies to reach their prey."
